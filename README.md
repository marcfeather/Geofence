# Geofence

Version 1.0

Geofence app is designed to create virtual fences around an assigned location. Once you reach that location, you will not only be notified, but you will receive an ETA.
The UI is very simple, so you can create your Geofence in no time.
Geofence app also has a widget that let you know if you are in or out your designed location radius. You don't even have to open the app!

The app is iOS 7 and 8 compatible.
